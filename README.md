### Included in this repository is all of the Lab assignments from my computer systems course.
  
#### Lab 1
* This lab demonstrates your ability to categorize different types of integers and floating point numbers based on their sequence of bits.

#### Lab 2
* This lab was to practice writing inline assembly code in C.

#### Lab 3
* Part 1: Use various techniques to improve the runtime of the program (loop unrolling, aliasing...).
* Part 2: Decode a string based solely on assembly code for a program (used GDB).

#### Lab 4
* Wrote a program that uses fork() and pipe() to allow a child process and parent process to communicate with eachother.

#### Lab 5
* This Lab demonstrated your understanding of the floating point stack in order to write inline assembly code in order to solve quadratic equations.
